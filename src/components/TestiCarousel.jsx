As a primarily coding and portfolio instructor, I have consistently watched her go above and beyond the requirements in building strong, scalable projects. Beyond technical skills, Yooranâ€™s inquisitive attitude is a key component to her success. Often, as I worked one-on-one with her on her code, she would ask, "Why though?" to new concepts she was applying and new challenges she was overcoming. This inquisitive nature and her commitment to understanding what she builds has led her to take on larger projects, teach herself new concepts, and advance her learning in our program. I have no doubt Yooran will be successful in any team she joins.',

Moreover, she consistently shows a willingness to upgrade her development skills by adopting and mastering new technologies.
